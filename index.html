        <div id="activities_title"><p>In my free time after school I participate in a number of different activities including:</p></div>
        <ul>
            <div class=activity><li>Model UN </div>
                <div class=description><ul>
                    <li>In Model UN I have attended conferences all over NYC, even one at the actual UN! Currently, I am a member of the mentorship team at my school, where I help students who are new to Model UN. I have been in committees such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Economic and Financial Committee(EcoFin), UN Security Council, Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee(SOCHUM), along with others.</li></ul></div>
            </li>
            <div class=activity><li>Finance and Investment Club </div>
                <div class=description><ul>
                    <li>In the Finance and Investment Club we participate in challenges such as the Euro Challenge and the Federal Reserve Challenge against other schools. Next year I will be the Secretary of the club, and I am very excited. In Spring of 2020, I was a part of the team that participated in the Europ Challenge and we won 3rd place!</li>
                </ul></div>
            </li>
            <div class=activity><li>Math Center </div>
                <div class=description><ul>
                    <li>Students can come to Math Center both before and after the school day and recieve help with homework, classwork, or just general studying for math. I am a tutor for Math Center, meaning I help any students who need it in subjects such as Algebra, Geometry, and Pre-calculus.</li>
                </ul></div></li>
            <div class=activity><li>Math Club </div>
                <div class=description><ul>
                    <li>Although they both have to do with math, Math Club and Math Center are two different activities. In Math Club we typically work on competition-style math problems, however we also have a lot of freedom and can discuss other math-related topics as well.</li>
                </ul></div></li>
            <div class=activity><li>Spanish Club </div>
                <div class=description><ul>
                    <li>Despite what the name of the club may suggest, you do not actually need to be able to speak Spanish to participate in Spanish Club. We usually speak in English, unless we have a guest speaker who is not completely fluent in English. Even then, we speak mostly English and speaking in Spanish is optional. During club meetings, we often discuss current events issues in Latin American countries, or have discussions with guest speakers from all around the world.</li>
